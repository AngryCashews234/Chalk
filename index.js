 One-day Max and Nathan went for a walk in the park, during the time Max smelled the sweet \
 deliciousness of hamburgers in a food truck driving down the highway. Max ran off into a crowd\
 of people chasing the food truck. In a panic, Nathan sprints into motion chasing Max, but he \
disappears within the crowd. Nathan asked several of the people during the notion if they have\
seen Max, but no one knew where he went. Once Nathan returned home his parents and him went\
 into action, getting the word out about Max disappearance. They put up flayers around the town, \
 called the animal shelters, and even called the police if they have seen a golden retriever around. \
 Weeks and months went by and no one has said word about the whereabouts of Max. "));

 of Max on a telephone pole. She said to herself in astonishment 'I know that dog!' Then out of\
 the corner of her eye, she saw max digging through the trash, looking for food. She ran over to\
the dog and yelled Come here Max! With enjoyment Max came running over, jumped on her and \
licking her face. Kaylee put Max into her car and drove to Nathan’s house. At his house, Nathan \
heard the doorbell ring and went to go see who was there. In shock he saw both Max and Kaylee \
there. Kaylee said with sarcasm, I think he is yours? and chuckled.  Nathan gave Max the biggest\
hug in the world and said, thank you so much Kaylee, it’s been forever since I saw you. Kaylee\
replied, I know that’s what happens when you move away for college. They both laughed and went \
on inside. They became caught up with each other about old times of being in high school and the\
 funny stuff they used to do. Nathan looked at Kaylee and said, Best Friends? Kaylee replied,\
 Yeah and this time forever."));
